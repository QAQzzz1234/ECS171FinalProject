## Project Purpose:
The goal of this project is to predict flight delay conditions mainly based on locations of destination and origin, flight distance and dates. The output is expected to be a classification index. 

## Dataset information:
The dataset is found from Kaggle's “2015 Flight Delays and Cancellations”, originally abstracted from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). 
Link: "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays?select=flights.csv"

Three csv files are included:
  airlines.csv: include two columns with Airline identifier and Airline full name.
  airports.csv: detail information for each airport (includes LATITUDE and LONGITUDE)
  flights.csv: detail of each flight (5819079 samples) in USA from 2015. Model will mainly relay on this data. 

## Setup(download data):
First two cell from FinalProject.ipynb is for setting up the data.Three csv files mentioned previously are saved in the googledrive. Please run the cells to download the data files.
